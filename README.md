# project_b
The purpose of this project was to design and implement a spike sorting algorithm that improves sorting classification for non-isolated spikes.

The proposed Superimposed Template Correlation Method (STCM) reduces the number of false positive errors due to overlapping spikes and improves overall accuracy when compared to standard methods.
