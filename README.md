Project B

The purpose of this project is to design and implement an effective and efficient spike sorting algorithm using MATLAB. The goal of my designed algorithm is to be able to show that my Superimposed Template Correlation Method (STCM) reduces the number of false positive errors due to overlapping spikes and improves overall accuracy when compared to standard methods.
